Understanding rivers requires diving into the scientific subjects, human lives, and geographical locations that are shaped by them. I explored the stories of four major processes through which rivers change our lives and planet: The Sedimentary Cycle, The Carbonate Cycle, How Rivers Live (shaping and being shaped by biology), and How Rivers Die (at the hands of humans who alter and over-use them). Using my experience as a photographer, kayaker, scientist, educator and farmer I followed these stories along the rivers that tell them, from the Himalayas to the Amazon.
