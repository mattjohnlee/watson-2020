My Watson Year offers a crucial break from a microscopic view of HIV. I plan to learn about creative community-centred interventions to combat HIV/AIDS from both community-run healthcare organisations and larger, institutional responses to the HIV pandemic. Through this intentional exploration, I also hope to get a sense of the solidarity and fellowship that arises from – and despite – the suffering that this pandemic has caused among the hardest-hit communities.
