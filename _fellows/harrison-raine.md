Climate change is increasing wildfire frequency and severity
  - causing ecological shifts and societal damage. Many nations are not prepared for these trends
  - others mis-frame the issue as a human versus nature conflict. I investigated fire history
  - ecology
  - and management in fire-prone countries. I aimed to understand the feasibility of balancing ecological needs against societal fears.
